# Intermittent-demand-forecasting-with-and-without-telemetry-data
## About
This repository contains all the code produced during my graduate work to obtain a PhD from Polytechnique Montreal.
The work was done in partnership with a large chemical supplier operating in the contiguous united states.
The work consisted on intermittent demand forecasting of this supplier operating in a B2B VMI arrangement with partial access to customers' on-site telemetric demand data.
Raw data was provided by the industrial partner but cannot be shared in the repo.

## Requirements
Dependency management was done using [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/). All requirements can be found in the packrat.lock file.
Dependencies can be installed by following the packrat guide.

## Papers
3 papers were produced for this research and can be found in their respectively numbered subfolder of the papers folder.
